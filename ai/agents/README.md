## AI Agents Submodule - Jarvis 4.0

This submodule, located within the main AI module, is dedicated to defining and implementing various specialized AI agents for Jarvis 4.0. Each agent is designed to handle specific types of tasks, leveraging the core AI capabilities of the system.

### Files

- **`__init__.py`**: Initializes the `agents` submodule, making it a Python package.
- **`coding_agent.py`**:
    - **Description**: The `CodingAgent` is responsible for handling tasks related to software development and coding. This includes code generation, debugging, code review, and suggesting code improvements.
    - **Functionality**:
        - Code generation from natural language descriptions.
        - Identification and correction of code errors.
        - Code optimization and refactoring suggestions.
        - Integration with development tools and environments.
- **`search_agent.py`**:
    - **Description**: The `SearchAgent` is designed to perform intelligent searches across various information sources. This could include web searches, local file system searches, and knowledge base queries.
    - **Functionality**:
        - Interpreting search queries to understand user intent.
        - Utilizing multiple search engines and APIs.
        - Filtering and ranking search results for relevance.
        - Summarizing and presenting search findings in a user-friendly format.

### Agent Architecture

Each agent in this submodule is built to be:

- **Modular**: Agents are designed to be independent and focused on specific tasks, allowing for easy addition, modification, or removal of agents.
- **Context-Aware**: Agents utilize the `ContextManager` to maintain and leverage context from previous interactions and ongoing tasks.
- **Communicative**: Agents can communicate with each other and with other modules of Jarvis 4.0 to coordinate complex tasks.

### Usage

The `AgentManager` in the parent AI module is responsible for instantiating, managing, and deploying these agents as needed. Developers can extend this submodule by adding new agent definitions to handle additional functionalities within Jarvis 4.0.

This submodule is critical for enabling Jarvis 4.0 to autonomously perform a wide range of tasks, from coding assistance to information retrieval, enhancing its utility and intelligence.
