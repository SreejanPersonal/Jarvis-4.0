## Device Manager - Devices Module - Jarvis 4.0

### Overview

The `device_manager.py` file within the Devices module is responsible for handling the lifecycle and control of devices connected to Jarvis 4.0. It provides functionalities for device discovery, registration, command execution, and status monitoring. This component acts as the central hub for device interactions within the Jarvis 4.0 ecosystem.

### Functionality

1.  **Device Discovery**:
    *   Automatically discovers devices on local networks or via supported protocols.
    *   Supports various discovery methods (e.g., UPnP, Bonjour, custom protocols).
    *   Provides interfaces for manual device addition if automatic discovery fails.

2.  **Device Registration**:
    *   Registers discovered devices with Jarvis 4.0, assigning unique IDs and storing device metadata.
    *   Manages device profiles, including device type, capabilities, and communication protocols.
    *   Persists device registration information for system restarts.

3.  **Device Control**:
    *   Provides a unified API for controlling registered devices, abstracting device-specific protocols.
    *   Supports sending commands to devices to perform actions (e.g., turn on/off, set volume, change settings).
    *   Handles command queuing and execution management, ensuring reliable device control.

4.  **Device Status Monitoring**:
    *   Monitors the status and health of registered devices.
    *   Periodically polls devices for status updates or utilizes push notifications from devices.
    *   Detects device disconnections and reconnections, updating device status accordingly.

5.  **Device Grouping and Management**:
    *   Allows grouping devices for easier management and control (e.g., "Living Room Lights", "Office Devices").
    *   Supports batch commands to control groups of devices simultaneously.
    *   Provides tools for organizing and managing a large number of devices.

### Class: `DeviceManager`

The main class in this file is `DeviceManager`, which encapsulates the functionalities described above.

*   **Methods**:
    *   `discover_devices()`: Initiates device discovery process.
    *   `register_device(device_info)`: Registers a new device.
    *   `unregister_device(device_id)`: Unregisters a device.
    *   `control_device(device_id, command, parameters)`: Sends a control command to a specific device.
    *   `get_device_status(device_id)`: Retrieves the current status of a device.
    *   `get_all_devices()`: Returns a list of all registered devices.
    *   `create_device_group(group_name, device_ids)`: Creates a new device group.
    *   `delete_device_group(group_id)`: Deletes a device group.
    *   `control_device_group(group_id, command, parameters)`: Sends a control command to a group of devices.

### Usage

The `DeviceManager` is instantiated and used by other modules within Jarvis 4.0 that require device interaction, such as the `home_automation.py` module or user interface components. It provides a clean and consistent interface for managing and controlling devices, simplifying device integration throughout the system.

### Dependencies

*   Potentially depends on libraries for specific device communication protocols (e.g., `requests` for HTTP, `socket` for network communication, specific libraries for smart home platforms).
*   Utilizes the `core.config` module for configuration settings related to device management.
*   Relies on the `core.logger` module for logging device-related events and errors.

This component is essential for Jarvis 4.0's ability to interact with and control external devices, providing a foundation for home automation, device synchronization, and other device-centric features.
